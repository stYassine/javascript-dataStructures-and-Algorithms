// What is a Stack ?
- a Stack is like a can of tennis balls
- when we add something to a stack, we say we're pushing an item to the Stack
- and if we're removing an item from the Stack it's popping

/// getting an item
- if you have a stack with 2 items in it,
you can't remove the bottom one,
you need to remove the top item first


// LIFO
Last In First Out

- a very common way of implementing a stack is to use an Array
- and remember with a stack, we're going to add and remove from the same end,
does not matter which end that is 

- where not going to use an array because it's already included in JS,
and we want to write some code

// in an Interview
- when they ask you how would you implement a stack with an Array
- it does matter which end you use:
- when you add something to the end of the Array or you remove it,
it's O(1)

- where as you do it on the other end (beginning),
remember you have re-index the Entire array, after adding or removing
it's O(n)

- so if you're going to do a stack with an array ALWAYS do it on the End,
you're just going to push or pop
